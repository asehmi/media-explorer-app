# Choose from one of these mutually exclusive modes:
#
#   'remote_server':
#       A standalone remote server should be started before (and independently of) the client app.
#       This should be used for distributed client-server deployments.
#       The server host, port, and http protocol must be set accordingly.
#   'embedded_server':
#       A standalone local server will be started and run in its own thread from the client app
#       This should be used for localhost client-server deployments.
#       The server host, port, and http protocol must be set accordingly.
#   'service_object':
#       No server is involved and instead the client app will directly call a media service object interface.
#       This should be used for simple local and Streamlit Cloud deployments.
#       Server host, port, and http protocol are ignored.

# Assign the cloud host AFTER you know the deployment URL
# ( To deploy on Heroku you must configure a 'Procfile' and 'setup.sh',
#   and separate the frontend and backend deployments. Launching FastAPI in
#   Streamlit Cloud hasn't worked for me due to port binding issues. )
